# Pikes Peak Library District challenged materials
This repo contains [a CSV](https://github.com/cjwinchester/ppld-challenges/blob/master/ppld-challenges.csv) with details on materials held by the Pikes Peak Library District that were challenged by members of the public.

All but two "request for reconsideration," as they're known, were declined ("retained as classified") in keeping with the district's [challenged materials policy](https://ppld.org/challenged-materials-policy). The other two were simply reshelved.

An assistant to the chief librarian provided me with [a PDF](https://github.com/cjwinchester/ppld-challenges/blob/master/PPLD%20Requests%20for%20Reconsideration%202001-2017.pdf) listing challenges from 2001-2017. There were no challenges in 2012, 2014, 2015 or 2018. The library did not have individual records related to four challenges in 2008 and two challenges in 2010 (all materials were retained as classified).
